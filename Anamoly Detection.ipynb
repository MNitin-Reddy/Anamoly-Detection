    "Implementing an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.\n",

    "   * throughput (mb/s) and \n",
    "   * latency (ms) of response of each server.\n",

    "While servers were operating, we collected $m=307$ examples of how they were behaving, and thus have an unlabeled dataset $\\{x^{(1)}, \\ldots, x^{(m)}\\}$. \n",
    "* You suspect that the vast majority of these examples are “normal” (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset.\n",

    "You will use a Gaussian model to detect anomalous examples in your\n",
    "dataset. \n",
    "* We will first start on a 2D dataset that will allow you to visualize what the algorithm is doing.\n",
    "* On that dataset we will fit a Gaussian distribution and then find values that have very low probability and hence can be considered anomalies. \n",
    "* After that, we will apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger dataset with many dimensions. \n",

    "    - You will use `X_val` and `y_val` as a cross validation set to select a threshold and determine anomalous vs normal examples"
